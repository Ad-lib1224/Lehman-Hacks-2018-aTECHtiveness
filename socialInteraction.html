    <h1>About Social Interation Skill-Building</h1>
    <p>
      Social Interaction Skill Building consists of activities that will help students understand and improve their social skills with other students. It includes diagrams that teach “thinking with your eyes” and role-playing games (RPG) that teach how the exhibition of different emotions affect other people. While drawing eyes with the aris in different positions stress the importance of eye contact, an RPG called “Hitchhiking Emotions” provides an opportunity for children to discuss the consequences of interruptions while someone is speaking, hitting a child while playing a game, or making a face when asked to do something. Cartoon-like figures depicting social situations can be provided for the child to arrange in sequence and explain. </p>

      Again, students will provide feedback at the end of the activity. They will build reactions/responses to the games using a click-and-drag feature. For example, they would have several phrases including “I agree with…” “I think this would be better if…”  and “I like how you…” in a phrase bank to choose from. They will "click" the phrase and drag it out and begin their sentences. This enables students to respectfully expresses their ideas and offer constructive feedback. They will also rate their activities using the same emotional scale.
