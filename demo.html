<h1>the Lion who
Wouldn't Try</h1>
<p>It was a sunny day in the jungle.</p>
<p>All the animals were out playing.</p>
<p>“Come play with me, Lion,” said Cheetah.</p>
<p>“Catch me if you can!”</p>
<p>zoom-zoom! went Cheetah.</p>
<p>“I don’t want to play,” said Lion. “I’ll lose.”</p>
<p>“Come play with me, Lion,” said Elephant.</p>
<p>“We can throw rocks!”</p>
<p>ka-pow! ka-pow! went Elephant.</p>
<p>“I don’t want to play,” said Lion. “I’ll lose.”</p>
<p>“Come play with us, Lion!” said the monkeys.</p>
<p>“Who can eat the most bananas?”</p>
<p>pop! pop! pop! went the monkeys.</p>
<p>“I don’t want to play,” said Lion. “I’ll lose.”</p>
<p>“Come play with me, Lion," said Springbok.</p>
<p>“Let’s jump high!”</p>
<p>zoop! zoop! zoop! went Springbok.</p>
<p>“I don’t want to play,” said Lion. “I’ll lose.”</p>
<p>“Come play with me, Lion,” said Crocodile.</p>
<p><b>“It’s a swimming competition!”</b></p>
<p>splash! splash! went Crocodile.</p>
<p>“I don’t want to play,” said Lion. “I’ll lose.”</p>
<p>Crocodile was quicker than Elephant,</p>
<p>but each time Crocodile got ahead,</p>
<p>Elephant tickled him!</p>
<p><b>tee-hee-hee! went Elephant and Crocodile.</b></p>
<p>Elephant and Crocodile had the swimming</p>
<p>competition without Lion.</p>
<p>Lion sat sadly by himself, watching Crocodile and
Elephant swim.<p>
<p><b>“Why are you sad, Lion?” asked Mouse.
“Because I don't want to play,” said Lion.
“I'll lose."</b></p>
<p>Lion slipped on a banana peel!
wheeeeee! went Lion.</p>
<p><b><i>“That looks like fun!” said all the other animals. Lion played,and he was happy.</i></b></p>
